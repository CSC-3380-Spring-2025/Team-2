# About Our Software
Bubble is an order/pick up app. Where the user can app drinks to their cart
then checkout by specifying the pickup location. Users can favorite items and 
earn reward points. At the same time, the managers of Bubble can edit menu items,
add or delete items, keep track of orders currently being made and which are 
completed. The app can check who is an admin or not, to control who sees and 
alters what in the app.

Describe how the commands and process to launch the project on the main branch in such a way that anyone working on the project knows how to check the affects of any code they add.

```sh
Example terminal command syntax
```

It is very common in these sections to see code in peculiar boxes to help them stand out. Check the markdown section of the Project Specifications to see how to add more / customize these.

```python
def code_highlight_example(m: int, m: float, s: str) -> str:
	return s + str(n*m)
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
	System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

```c#
static void Main(){
	Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
}
```
