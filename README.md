It is very common in these sections to see code in peculiar boxes to help them stand out. Check the markdown section of the Project Specifications to see how to add more / customize these.

```python
def code_highlight_example(m: int, m: float, s: str) -> str:
	return s + str(n*m)
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
	System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

```c#
static void Main(){
	Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
}
```
